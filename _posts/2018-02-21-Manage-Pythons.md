People who use Python, on linux or mac, may find it is difficult to manage the different versions of Python.
After comparing several common [tools](http://masnun.com/2016/04/10/python-pyenv-pyvenv-virtualenv-whats-the-difference.html), it seems [*pyenv*](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is the most competent one.
