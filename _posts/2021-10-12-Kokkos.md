### Building and Installing Kokkos with Cmake

```
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/g++ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/data/code/myLibs/kokkos -DKokkos_ENABLE_OPENMP=On -DKokkos_ARCH_HSW=On -DKokkos_ENABLE_HWLOC=On
    make -j 4 & make install
```

#### Small project (single source file) using Kokkos
Suppose we have an application called *myApp.cpp*, which uses Kokkos. The *CMakeLists.txt* codes such as following
```
    cmake_minimum_required (VERSION 3.10)
    project (myApp)
    find_package(Kokkos REQUIRED)
    
    add_executable(myApp myApp.cpp)
    target_link_libraries(myApp Kokkos::kokkos)
```

And the application is simply built as
```
    cmake . -DKokkos_DIR=/data/code/myLibs/kokkos/lib/cmake/Kokkos
    make 
    export OMP_NUM_THREADS=8
    export OMP_PROC_BIND=spread OMP_PLACES=threads
    ./myApp
```

### Inline Builds
For individual projects, it may be preferable to build Kokkos inline rather than link to an installed package. The main reason is that you may otherwise need many different configurations 
of Kokkos installed depending on the required compile time features an application needs. For example there is only one default execution space, which means you need different installations 
to have OpenMP or Pthreads as the default space. Also for the CUDA backend there are certain choices, such as allowing relocatable device code, which must be made at installation time. 
Building Kokkos inline uses largely the same process as compiling an application against an installed Kokkos library.

For CMake, this means copying over the Kokkos source code into your project and adding *add_subdirectory(kokkos)* to your *CMakeLists.txt*.
