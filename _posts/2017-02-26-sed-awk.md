#### Understanding Basic Operations
Sed is stream-oriented, it cannot be used interactively. By default, all of the input to sed passes through and goes to standard output. 
The input file itself is not changed. *Sed applies a command* without an address *to every line in the file* (global-line addressing).  
For example

```
    s/regular/complex/   #subsitute every lines contain regular by complex
```

Awk was developed as a programmable editor that, like sed, is stream-oriented and interprets a script of editing commands. 
Where awk departs from sed is in discarding the line-editor command set. It offers in its place a programming language modeled on the C language. 
The print statement replaces the p command, for example. The concept of addressing is carried over, such that:

```
    /regular/ {print }
```

prints those lines matching "regular". The braces ({}) surround a series of one or many statements that applied to the same address.
