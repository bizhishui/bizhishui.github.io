Reading notes on a very good review on [Low-Reynolds-Number Flows](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/Chapter/9781782628491-00025/978-1-78262-849-1) from physical view by H. A. Stone and C. Dupart.

### 1. Typical results for low-reynolds-number flows

1. A sphere of radius $$a$$ that translates at a speed $$V$$ far from any walls and in a large bath of fluid experiences a drag force of magnitude

$$
\begin{equation}
F_D=6\pi\mu a V.
\end{equation}
$$

This result is known as the Stokes drag, corresponds to the product of the surface area $$4\pi a^2$$ and a typical shear stress $$\mu V/a$$.
Unlike $${\color{blue}{high\ Reynolds\ numer\ flow}}$$ limit, where the drag force varies approximately with the square of the particle radius and 
square of the speed.

2. Because of gravity, a sphere of radius $$a$$ and density $$\rho_s$$ sediments in a viscous fluid of density $$\rho$$ with a net force 
of $$(4\pi/3)a^3(\rho_s-\rho)g$$. The sedimentation speed $$V$$ can be deduced by balancing the drag force

$$
\begin{equation}
V=\frac{2a^2(\rho_s-\rho)g}{9\mu},
\end{equation}
$$

i.e. $${\color{blue}{V\propto a^2}}$$.
