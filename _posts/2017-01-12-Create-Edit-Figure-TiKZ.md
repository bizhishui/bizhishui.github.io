### Create a Figure with TikZ


### Edit a Figure with TIKZ
Suppose we have a figure as show below:

[![Initial figure](/media/files/2017/01/12/ExpComp.png)](https://github.com/bizhishui/bizhishui.github.io/blob/master/ "Initial figure")

<img src="https://github.com/bizhishui/bizhishui.github.io/blob/master/media/files/2017/01/12/ExpComp.png" alt="Initial figure" width="200" height="200" />

we want add some text, for example, on it. One common option is use photoshop like software, here is the post-result with *inkscape*
