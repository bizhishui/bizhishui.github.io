Use *rm* command it will delete the files permanently and doesnâ€™t move those files to *Trash Can* like how file manger does.
This post introduce a [script](https://github.com/lagerspetz/linux-stuff/blob/master/scripts/saferm.sh) to avoid this situation.

Download the script and put it a directory contained in *PATH*
```
    wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lagerspetz/linux-stuff/master/scripts/saferm.sh -O $HOME/bin/saferm.sh
```
In *bashrc* file, set
```
    alias rm=saferm.sh
    exec $SHELL
```
